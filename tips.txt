When the app first starts, the output window displays the state changes of Activity A:

[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnCreate
[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnStart
[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnResume
When we click the Start Activity B button, we see Activity A pause and stop while Activity B goes through its state changes:

[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnPause
[ActivityLifecycle.SecondActivity] Activity B - OnCreate
[ActivityLifecycle.SecondActivity] Activity B - OnStart
[ActivityLifecycle.SecondActivity] Activity B - OnResume
[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnStop
As a result, Activity B is started and displayed in place of Activity A:

When we click the Back button, Activity B is destroyed and Activity A is resumed:

[ActivityLifecycle.SecondActivity] Activity B - OnPause
[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnRestart
[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnStart
[ActivityLifecycle.MainActivity] Activity A - OnResume
[ActivityLifecycle.SecondActivity] Activity B - OnStop
[ActivityLifecycle.SecondActivity] Activity B - OnDestroy
