        After Send, show an Amount Prompt:  “Charge what amount?”, followed by
        a Carribean-sea-colored line for the user to type the amount in
        (if such a background color is hard to do, temporarily skip it
        and just do it however is easy).

    User types “10000” (the digits appear in the box), and presses “Send”.
