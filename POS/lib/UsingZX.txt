Using the ZX (Zebra Crossing) library:

   
    Install Apache Ant
    Download the ZXing source from ZXing homepage and extract it
        (http://code.google.com/p/zxing/downloads/list)
    From the command line, navigate to the directory "core" in the extracted directory
    Type "ant" and enter.  Ant will build the lib.
    Move core.jar from the current directory to this directory ($PROJECT/lib)
    From Eclipse, Right-click project folder -> Properties -> Java Build Path
        -> Library -> Add External JARs...
    Navigate to the newly extracted folder and open the core directory and select core.jar
