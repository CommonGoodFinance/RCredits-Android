To Do:
. rework KeyguardManager lines with WindowManager.FLAG_DISMISS_KEYGUARD (see zxing code for tips)
. fix rSmart tests
. LATER talk to Blake about why not to use AyncTask
. LATER use assets instead of literals
. LATER change negative amount messages (for refunds, undo-refunds, and balance) to the appropriate positives
. LATER ask user to confirm small and large amounts (a magnitude off their average? -- research bank algorithms)
. LATER settings activity: simply (Toast) say all settings are on website?
. LATER customer activity: show just ID as name, while async activity fills in the rest
. LATER change "change desc" button to fling left?
. LATER change "r->" buttons to swipe left and right?
. LATER make "r"s fly from Customer screen toward Charge activity on the right and in from Refund activity on the left?
. LATER (for tests) keep acore from repetitive death on fakeScan mode
. LATER refactor to put entire zxing android module untouched (possibly in a jar), and just override as needed. This may not be possible, but come close (probably have to keep it in org.rcredits.zxing)

. scrapped the plan for a hybrid app
. changed CaptureActivity to portrait, revised and added buttons
. created Customer, Tx, and Change Description activities
. set up static params and functions in Application A
. created rCard class
. very rough and incomplete, but all the major pieces are there (scanning, navigating, data entry, storage, RPC, error handling)
