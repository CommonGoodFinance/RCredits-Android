. many thanks to Blake, who showed the way, and to the ZXing team who did the heavy lifting
. brought zxing into the project (core/ and javase/ as jars, android/ directly)
. scrapped the plan for a hybrid app
. changed CaptureActivity to portrait, revised and added buttons
. created Customer, Tx, and Change Description activities
. set up static params and functions in Application A
. created rCard class
. very rough and incomplete, but all the major pieces are there (scanning, navigating, data entry, storage, RPC, error handling)
