RPC API Definition
(see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZE_wmEBRTBO9DAZcY4ewQTA70gqwWqeqkUnJSfWMV0)

Basic params (always sent):
op       the requested operation
device   the device ID (supplied once by the server) -- empty if none
agent    the already-scanned-in agent's agent ID (for example NEW:AAB) -- ignored for "update" op
version  release version of the running app

REQUESTS:
 * identify:	[member, code] => [ok, message, logon="1", name, descriptions[], can, device, update]
 * identify:	[member, code] => [ok, message, logon="0", name, place, company, balance]
 * photo:	[member] => photo
 * charge:	[member, amount, goods, description] => [ok, message, tx, balance, undo]
 * undo:	[tx] => [ok, message, balance]

Notes/Ideas:
 
. All API parameters are lowercase with underlines. All values are strings or string arrays.
. All internal variables are camelCase
. Some devices with a front-only camera do not report this properly to Android, so we build an alternate version of the app (rposb) by uncommenting a line in the Application's onCreate(). That alternate app passes its version code with a leading zero, to tell the server which upgrade URL to return, when appropriate.

Tests:
First-time sign-in as Bob
First-time sign-in as Susan
First-time sign-in as CGF
Signed out sale to Susan (1), undo (-1), Helga's (2) / balance

Turn wifi back on, charge Curt (5) (txs 1,-1,2,4,5 show up)
Sign in, Self-service mode Curt (6)
Scan Susan's generated QR
Update of previous version (data is preserved)
