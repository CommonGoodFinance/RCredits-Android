RPC API Definition
(see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZE_wmEBRTBO9DAZcY4ewQTA70gqwWqeqkUnJSfWMV0)

Basic params (always sent):
op       the requested operation
device   the device ID (supplied once by the server) -- empty if none
agent    the already-scanned-in agent's agent ID (for example NEW:AAB) -- ignored for "update" op
version  release version of the running app

REQUESTS:
 * identify:	[member, code] => [ok, message, logon="1", name, descriptions[], can, device, update]
 * identify:	[member, code] => [ok, message, logon="0", name, place, company, balance]
 * photo:	[member] => photo
 * charge:	[member, amount, goods, description] => [ok, message, tx, balance, undo]
 * undo:	[tx] => [ok, message, balance]

Notes/Ideas:
 
In case we need to handle reverse images (and they aren't handled automatically):
Find where PlanarYUVLuminanceSource is instantiated in CameraManager. Its last parameter is "false". Just change it to "true" and it will flip over the image.
